# ML / LLM Usage
This project does not use machine learning models in the current implementation.

## Status
- ML is not integrated in code execution.
- Recommendations are rule-based (weather thresholds and plant catalog rules).

## Future option
If required later, an LLM could be used only to explain analytics results,
without changing any calculation logic or data sources.
